 ## Exam hall Temperature Monitoring System
 
 
 
## Abstract
The Exam hall Temperature Monitoring system is basically used to monitor the temperature of the Exam hall according to the number of students presented in the Hall. When the students gets seated, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the Exam hall analyser gets access to turn on the heater.The temperature sensor buttons keeps monitoring the temperature of the Exam hall on the basis of students available in Hall and sends the analog value to the ATmega328 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor button and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the regulating system is performed with a microcontroller called Atmega328 and monitored by LCD serial communication o/p..
